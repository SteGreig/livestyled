# ACF Pro

> The site uses ACF Pro for creating custom fields.

## Local JSON

If you don't know what [Local JSON](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/local-json/) is then you need to read up on it.

Never under any circumstances change fields on staging or production. The fields must always be synced from dev using the JSON files so that they are managed within version control.

## Keep it tidy

The backend / dashboard should remain tidy for the end user so take advantage of the layout options ACF offers.

Do not over complicate the backend, it should be easy for a user to navigate between the different blocks within a page builder for example.
