= 2.2.0 - Adorned SEO =

**Release date:**

* November 5th, 2019

**Feature highlights:**

* A new extension settings overview has been added. The Articles extension is the first to support this.
* The interface is now much cleaner, swifter, and far more accessible. It is also in line with the upcoming WordPress 5.3 update.
* The plugin now requires:
	* WP 4.9 or higher.
	* TSF 4.0 or higher.
	* PHP 5.6.5 or higher.

**A few notes on browser support:**

The new interface now relies on bleeding-edge technology, which is an auto-fit grid with collapse and span-growth support. This technology isn't new, but until recently, no browser supported it well. To make sure everything works as intended:

* Chrome v77 (September 10th, 2019) equivalent or higher are now required.
* Safari v13 (September 19th, 2019) or higher is now required.

These browsers support the interface well enough, but may look slightly different from what's intended, because they don't support shrinking elements in grid yet:

* Firefox v70 (October 22nd, 2019) equivalent or higher are now required.
* Edge v44.18 (May 21st, 2019) or higher is now required.

_All hope for Internet Explorer is lost._

If the layout looks blatantly wrong on Chrome or Firefox (that is, items overlapping), go to "Menu -> Help -> About Firefox/Chrome," and an update should be available.

Microsoft notoriously forces updates on us, so you should be fine with Edge. And Apple made their latest updates so attractive; we doubt you've skipped on those.
